# Welcome!
Welcome to the authenticator.
We created this verification bot to ensure with a very high guarrentee that no bots will make it past verification

## Why authenticator?
Most verification bots (not all, most) use simple methods of verification. Such as typing "I agree" or a reaction role.
Both of these methods can easily be cracked by a selfbot programmed to do harm to one's server, aka server botting.
Some other bot's while having pretty good features put them beind paywalls or otherwise.
Authenticator's image verification system is completely free and open source.

## Features?
Currently due to the new nature of the bot we only have a setup command, and some other basic commands.
The setup does not (yet) automatically setup channels for you. You will have to do this manually for now.

## Do you take suggestions?
Yes! We are open to suggestions, simply open an issue on our github or type .suggest (suggestion) in our support server in the designated channel.

## Commands
- a?help - Lists commands
- a?prefix - View and change the bot's prefix.
- a?ping - View the bot's current ping.
- a?setup - Starts the bot setup process.
